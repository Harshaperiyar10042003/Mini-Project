        <h2>Objective</h2>
        <p>The main objective of the project is to develop a wireless 
            notice board that display messages sent from the webserver. When a 
            user sends a message, it is received by a wifi Module through Local 
            Web Server. This project aims to develop a wireless display board that 
            displays messages sent via Local Webpage through WIFI network. The 
            main purposes to design this electronic notice board system is to 
            interface it with users mobile phones for displaying the latest 
            information. This proposed system in this paper has many upcoming 
            applications in educational institutions and organizations , crime 
            prevention , traffic management , railways , advertisements etc. Been 
            user friendly, long range and faster means of conveying information are 
            major bolsters for this application. By using this proposed 
            methodology we can enhance the security system and also make 
            awareness of the emergency situations and avoid many dangers. For this 
            purpose, Android based application programs for Bluetooth and Wi-Fi 
            communication between Android based personal digital assistant devices 
            and remote wireless display board are used Using the developed system, 
            two different applications for displaying messages on a remote digital 
            notice board and wireless person calling has been implemented. It also 
            helps in saving the time and the cost for paper and printing hardware.</p>

        <h2>About the Project</h2>
        <p>The proposed method consists of electronic notice board
            that is controlled by an android device and displays message on it.
            Traditionally, there were notice boards where any information or notice
            had to be stick daily. This becomes tedious and requires daily
            maintenance. The project the overcomes this problem by introducing an
            electronic display notice board interfaced to an android device through
            Bluetooth connectivity. The Bluetooth receives the message from the
            android device that is sent to an Arduino. Notice board is a primary
            thing in any institution/organization or public utility places like bus
            stations, railway stations and parks. But sticking various notices day-today is a difficult process. The Notice board is a common display for
            effective mode of providing information to the people, but this is not
            easy for updating the messages instantly. This project deals about an
            advanced Hi-Tech wireless Notice Board. This system is enhanced to
            display the latest information through an Android application of smart
            phones or tablet. It has already established its importance in
            sharing the information right from household matters to worldwide
            phenomena. In this paper, we present the development of an SMS
            controlled E-notice board which can be updated automatically
            and remotely. The system was implemented using a
            Bluetooth Module IC controlled by a Microcontroller and an LCD display.</p>
